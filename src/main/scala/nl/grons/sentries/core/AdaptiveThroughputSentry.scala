/**
 * A sentry that adapts throughput with the success ratio of invoking the protected resource. Think of it as
 * a gradual circuit breaker.
 *
 * The goal of this sentry is to protect the caller from a resource that slows down, or starts to produce errors
 * when overloaded. By reducing throughput until success ratio is at an expected level, the resource can recover
 * and work at its optimal efficiency.
 *
 * For resources that behave correct most of the time, the target success ratio can be set quite high, e.g. `0.95`.
 * When exceptions are more 'normal', you may have to lower this parameter.
 *
 * The success ratio is calculated per `evaluationDelay` with a simple `1 - (fail count / success count)`.
 * When the success ratio is below `targetSuccessRatio`, the throughput is reduced to
 * `currentSuccessRatio * currentThroughputRatio`. When the success ratio is again equal to or above the target ratio,
 * throughput is increased by `successIncreaseFactor` (defaults to +20%) with a minimum of 0.0001D (1 in thousand calls
 * may proceed).
 * Note that regardless of the `currentThroughputRatio`, at least 1 call per evaluation period is allowed to continue.
 *
 * This sentry only makes sense for high volume resources. To prevent throttling in low volume times, it is possible
 * to set the minimum number of invocations that must be observed per `evaluationDelay` before throttling takes place.
 * (see the `minimumInvocationCountThreshold` parameter).
 *
 * It does not make sense to throttle on fast failing invocations. In those cases its better to get the exception
 * from the underlying resource then to get a [[ReducedThroughputException]]. Parameter `failedInvocationDurationThreshold`
 * sets the minimum duration of failed invocation in order for those invocations to be counted as failed. By setting
 * this value to a non-zero value, fast failures do not reduce throughput. (Note that the default is `0` for backward
 * compatibility.)
 *
 * When there is a calamity, this sentry only reacts as fast as the given `evaluationDelay` (1 second by default).
 * When the resource becomes fully available, it takes at most 39 evaluation before throughput is back at 100%.
 * You can test this by evaluating the following code in a Scala REPL:
 * {{{
 * scala> val successIncreaseFactor = 1.2D
 * successIncreaseFactor: Double = 1.2
 *
 * scala> Stream.iterate(0.0D)(x => (x * successIncreaseFactor).max(0.001).min(1.0D)).zipWithIndex.takeWhile(_._1 < 1.0).last._2 + 1
 * res0 Int = 39
 * }}}
 *
 * A new instance can be obtained through the [[nl.grons.sentries.SentrySupport]] mixin.
 *
 * @param owner the owner class of this sentry
 * @param resourceName name of the resource
 * @param targetSuccessRatio target success ratio, `0 < targetSuccessRatio < 1`, defaults to `0.95D`
 * @param evaluationDelay the time between calculations of the current throughput, defaults to 1 second
 * @param minimumInvocationCountThreshold the minimum number of invocations that must be observed per `evaluationDelay`
 *   before invocations are throttled, defaults to `0` (>=0)
 * @param successIncreaseFactor factor to apply to current throughput ratio, `successIncreaseFactor > 1`, defaults to 1.2D
 * @param failedInvocationDurationThreshold the minimum duration for a failed invocation to be counted as failed,
 *   for backward compatibility this defaults to 0 milliseconds. A better default would be a small number,
 *   e.g. `1 millisecond`.
