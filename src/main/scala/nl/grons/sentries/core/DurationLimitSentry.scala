/**
 * A sentry that limits the duration of an invocation.
 * A new instance can be obtained through the [[nl.grons.sentries.SentrySupport]] mixin.
 *
 * The goal of a duration limiter is to support callers that are only interested
 * in the results for a limited time.
 *
 * WARNING: do NOT use this sentry when you invoke it from a `Future` or an `Actor`.
 * For such circumstances you are MUCH better of with a timeout on the enclosing future or a timeout message
 * within the actor.
 * Reason: this sentry blocks the current thread while waiting on a future that executes the task. Blocking the
 * current thread is an anti-pattern for futures and actors.
 *
 * Note that when the wait period has passed, the task still completes in another thread. Make
 * sure there are enough threads in the executor. By default a `Executors.newCachedThreadPool()`
 * is used which creates as much threads as needed. The executor can be changed by overriding
 * [[.executionContext]].
